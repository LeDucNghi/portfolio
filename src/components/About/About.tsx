            My name is <b>Le Duc Nghi</b> and I have just graduated from{" "}
            <b>HUTECH University</b> recently with a major in Information
            Technology. During my time at university, I gained a foundation in
            HTML/CSS/SASS, especially ReactJS, and had the opportunity to work
            at Capgemini company as Intern. And I am eager to apply my skills
            and knowledge to real-world challenges and to continue learning and
            growing in my field.{" "}

            Through many projects, I have experience in designing and
            implementing user interfaces with <b>Figma</b> for web applications.
            In addition to these core skills, I have also worked with <b>MUI</b>{" "}
            for building responsive and accessible user interfaces. I have
            experience with state management using <b>ReduxJS</b> and have used
            tools such as <b>Redux-Toolkit</b> and <b>Redux-Thunk</b> to manage
            complex application states. My focus is on creating intuitive and
            responsive user experiences that meet the needs of the end user.
